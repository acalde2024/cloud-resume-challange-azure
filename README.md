# cloud-resume-challange-azure

This repo contains the second half of my Cloud Resume Challange for Azure. I wanted to do a diffrent approach and learn how to have a cloud agnostic mindset when setting up an web design infrastructure. This basic page is being hosted in Azure using Azure Static App to host my page and to enable auto CICD Pipeline for Azure
